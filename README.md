# Dell XPS 15 - 9560-OSX
This contains my modified files to run OS X 10.12.3, based on Andy^^s collection and my tutorial for the 9550.

You can follow my guide if you want to install Sierra on your own dell, but be aware, the tutorial is originally for the 9550.  
Best way is to download the 9550 repository and then overwrite the files with the ones from this repository. Then follow the tutorial as if it is the 9550.

Not working:
* Wifi (will never work, replacement required - [my suggestion][2])
* nVidia GPU (Intel IGF works well)
* SD Card reader
