# Dell XPS 15 - 9560-OSX
This repository contains the required files to make OSX 10.12 run on a Dell XPS 15 9560.  
  
 
## Deprecated
My files are officially deprecated and are superseded by the tutorial of KNNSpeed. You can read his tutorial on [on insanelymac][5] or as PDF version [here][3]. I also attached his files to this repository as a mirror but i really suggest using the newest versions from his thread. You may still need some of the original files in case KNNSpeeds tutorial is not working for you (for example when your drive is not 4Kn compatible).  
  
The original tutorial is still available at [readme_old.md][4] and requires the files from the [Dell 9550 Sierra Installation Guide][1]. 

## Not working
* Wifi (will never work, replacement required - [my suggestion][2])
* nVidia GPU (Intel IGF works well)
* SD Card reader
